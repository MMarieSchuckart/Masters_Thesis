# Merle's Master's Thesis Repo 
(last updated: August 24th 2021)

This repository is used to collect all the scripts I wrote for my master's thesis.

### Contents 
Currently, this repository only contains a script for reading in / preprocessing test data I got from Julius, but I'll also upload a stats script when I'm ready. :turtle:   

The data that I use to write the scripts right now are from a pilot study with a patient with Parkinson's disease.
