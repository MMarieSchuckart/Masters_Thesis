# Merle's Master's Thesis Repo 
(last updated: September 1st 2021)

This repository is used to collect all the scripts I wrote for my master's thesis.

### Contents 
This repository only contains a [script for reading in / preprocessing](/read_and_preproc_data.py) test data I got from Julius and another one for the [stats part](/stats.py).

This is work in progress (e.g. the analysis of the GSS data is still missing). 🐢

The data that I use to write the scripts right now are from a pilot study with a patient with Parkinson's disease, it's only a single file so I haven't tested it with the real data yet.
