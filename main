""" Main Script for Merle's Master's Thesis """
# Scripts by Merle Schuckart, written Sept. - Dec. 2021 
# Github: MMarieSchuckart
# Email: merle.schuckart@gmx.de

# Use this script to run the whole analysis 
# for Merle's Thesis or just run parts of it.


""" Before using this script...

Please make sure the packages MNE and pyxdf can be installed 
on your machine if you have never used them before.
You might need to pip install them in your terminal:
     pip install pyxdf
     pip install mne
  
If you can't pip install the latest stable pyxdf version directly, 
try installing the latest developer version from github 
by running this command in your terminal:
    pip install git+https://github.com/xdf-modules/pyxdf.git
    
I found this solution here: https://github.com/xdf-modules/pyxdf
(BTW: The internet says you should install PyPDF2 to be able to import pyxdf, 
but that doesn't work.)
"""  

# Please put your working directory with all .xdf files here.
# This file should also contain all other analysis scripts with the functions
# we execute herein.
