# I spent quite some time figuring this out: 
# You need to pip install pyxdf before being able to import it. 
# You can do this by copying one of the following lines into your terminal:

# Option 1: latest stable version (does not work for me)
# pip install pyxdf

# Option 2 (worked for me): latest developer version
# pip install git+https://github.com/xdf-modules/pyxdf.git
# I found this here: https://github.com/xdf-modules/pyxdf

# (The internet says you should install PyPDF2 
# to be able to import pyxdf, but that doesn't work)

# Now import package for reading in xdf data:
import pyxdf

# Python MNE for eeg data analysis / processing
# put this into your terminal to install python nme
    # pip install mne
# NME should be active by default and should already have the 
# necessary dependencies (numpy, scipy, and matplotlib).
